About Me:
<p align="left">
Hello, my name is Jonathan Gonzalez. I am a Java full stack engineer. I began my programming journey at the age of 13. My parents had just bought me a mini notebook laptop that was the size of my hand. I have always had a passion for gaming and tech so my love and journey for programming began ever since. It has been a difficult journey, but I persisted and graduate with a bachelor's in Computer science. It has now been over 11 years and yet there is so much more to learn; I still have the same passion as I did when I was 13 for programming and I am always looking to learn new skills.
